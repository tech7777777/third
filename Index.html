    <h1>What Is Dyslexia?</h1>

    <p>Dyslexia is a common learning difficulty that mainly causes problems with reading, writing and spelling.It's a
        specific learning difficulty, which means it causes problems with certain abilities used for learning, such as
        reading and writing.Unlike a learning disability, intelligence isn't affected.It's estimated up to 1 in every 10
        people in the UK has some degree of dyslexia. Dyslexia is a lifelong problem that can present challenges on a
        daily basis,but support is available to improvereading and writing skills and help those with the problem be
        successful at
        school and work.</p>

    <h1>Signs of Dyslexia</h1>

    <p>Signs of dyslexia usually become apparent when a child starts school and begins to focus more on learning how to
        read and write.A person with dyslexia may:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>read and write very slowly</li>
        <li>confuse the order of letters in words</li>
        <li>be confused by letters that look similar and write letters the wrong way round (such as "b" and "d")</li>
        <li>have poor or inconsistent spelling</li>
        <li>understand information when told verbally, but have difficulty with information that's written down</li>
        <li>find it hard to carry out a sequence of directions</li>
        <li>struggle with planning and organisation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But people with dyslexia often have good skills in other areas, such as creative thinking and problem
        solving.Read more about the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dyslexia/symptoms/" target="_blank">symptoms

    <h1>Getting Help</h1>

    <p>If you think your child may have dyslexia, the first step is to speak to their teacher or their school's special
        educational needs co-ordinator about your concerns.They may be able to offer additional support to help your
        child if necessary.If your child continues to have problems despite extra support, you or the school may want to
        consider requesting an in-depth assessment from a specialist in assessing specific learning difficulties (SpLD),
        an educational psychologist or a speech and language therapist.This can be arranged through the school, or you
        can request a private assessment by contacting:</p>
